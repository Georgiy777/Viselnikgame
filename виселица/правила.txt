Play individually or in groups. 
Have the student select a letter of the alphabet.
If the letter is contained in the word/phrase, the group or individual takes another turn guessing a letter.  To reveal a letter (depending on which slide template is used), either:
Click on the square with appropriate letter in it to reveal the letter within the word/phrase (used with slides 1 and 2)
Click on the letter in the alphabet area which will then trigger the letter to be revealed if it is contained in the word/phrase or change the color of the Try Again button indicating that the letter is not contained in the word/phrase (used with slide 3).
If the letter is not contained in the word/phrase, click the Try Again button, a portion of the hangman is added. 
The game continues until:
the word/phrase is guessed (all letters are revealed) – WINNER or,
all the parts of the hangman are displayed – LOSER
